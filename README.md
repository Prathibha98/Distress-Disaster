# Dizzaso The Disaster

  "An ounce of prevention is worth a pound of cure" 
  Right now we are in a situation where we need the solution that helps for the welfare of the people.
  So, here we are going to present our ideas. We are in a complicated world where the prediction of any disaster could be one tedious process.
  Any abnormal condition in the climatic condition leads to the disaster.So, our problem is to identify whether there could be any possibility for the occurrence of that abnormal condition.
  "Every coin has two sides"
  In the same way, the past data won't be much sufficient to predict any disaster.One such example is the RED ALERT of TAMILNADU.Similarly, too much of data may leads to the over-fitting of our problem.Along with the climatic condition such as temperature, pressure, humidity etc., astrology(Bag of Words) could also be one of the factor that may help us to solve our problem.This may seem silly but the science could help us.
  Next comes the prediction...
  How we are going to predict???
    we have several machine learning algorithms to predict our problem. our approach is the sum up of all machine learning models and final result is obtained from all the models.
